/// Plugins that make a module a runnable service, paired with the provider that
/// records how the launch layer must address it.
///
/// A framework is identified by the plugin it applies rather than by a
/// dependency or an annotation: the plugin is what contributes the goal that
/// starts the service, so if it is absent there is nothing to run whatever the
/// sources say. Each framework needs its own provider because the goals take
/// their arguments under different property names -- see `maven_arguments`.
///
/// The group is part of the identity: Maven resolves a declaration without a
/// `<groupId>` to `org.apache.maven.plugins`, so a bare `spring-boot-maven-plugin`
/// names another artifact entirely and does not select this provider.
///
/// A framework may publish its plugin under more than one official group.
/// Quarkus republishes the plugin under the platform's own `io.quarkus.platform`
/// group, and Micronaut 4.0 moved to `io.micronaut.maven` while
/// `io.micronaut.build` stays for the 3.x line. Each of those coordinates is
/// listed, and a same-named plugin under any other group still selects nothing.
