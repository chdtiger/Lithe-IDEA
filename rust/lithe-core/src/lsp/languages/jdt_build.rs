//! Coordination of JDT LS project builds requested by Run and Debug preparation.
//!
//! Java Debug Server's `vscode.java.buildWorkspace` builds every Java project in
//! the JDT workspace. Three upstream behaviors shape this coordinator:
//!
//! - Applying Maven profiles or changing build files schedules asynchronous JDT
//!   project-update jobs, and the command that scheduled them returns before the
//!   jobs finish. A build started meanwhile races JDT's own reconfiguration of
//!   classpaths, annotation processing, and output folders, so builds wait until
//!   those jobs report completion through work-done progress.
//! - Concurrent workspace builds in one JDT session contend for the same Eclipse
//!   workspace rule and share builder state. Core therefore runs at most one build
//!   per session and lets identical waiting requests share the next build.
//! - `$/cancelRequest` is advisory: JDT may keep building until an Eclipse job
//!   observes cancellation. A build stays tracked until JDT answers, even after
//!   every caller left, and the next build is not dispatched before that answer.
//!
//! The coordinator is a deterministic state machine. The engine supplies the
//! clock, allocates JSON-RPC IDs, and publishes the resulting events.
